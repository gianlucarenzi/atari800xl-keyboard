Keyboard layouts in SVG used to order keycaps from WASDKeyboards.

atari800xl-keyboard-save.svg - has black text and was used to do the layout

atari800xl-keyboard-final.svg - has white text and was used to order the
                                white-on-black/grey/orange custom keycaps

I used the "extra" keycaps available to try some variants of some of the
meta keys, and order some keyscaps with indicators from 2001 spacecraft
panels, for no particular reason.

The font used was Routed Gothic: https://webonastick.com/fonts/routed-gothic/
