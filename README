This is a work-in-progress replacement keyboard for the Atari800XL,
using Cherry MX mechanical key switches. 

- It is *not* entirely finished and production ready. 
- It has some clearance problems with the case top on the right hand side.  
- I do not have time to actively support it.

- Schematics and Layouts were done with KiCad 5.x

Parts Notes:
- A100254CT-ND (digikey) TE 2-84952-4 CONN FPC BOTTOM 24POS
